# OwlENV-Kernal-Rewrite
Beta version of the rewritten filesystem library I made for my unpublished web OS entitled Owl Env.

# How to use
Download the /kernel directory and import it into your project. In your HTML file(s), put the following code (anywhere should work as long as they have a ``<head>`` element)
```html
<script src="kernel/kernel.js"></script>
```

ill add documentation later but the functions in ``kernel/fs.js`` should be pretty self explanatory
